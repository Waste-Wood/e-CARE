# e-CARE: a New Dataset for Exploring Explainable Causal Reasoning

## Brief Introduction
Understanding causality has vital importance for various Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications. Beyond the labeled instances, conceptual explanations of the causality can provide deep understanding of the causal fact to facilitate the causal reasoning process. We present a human-annotated explainable CAusal REasoning dataset (e-CARE), which contains over 20K causal reasoning questions, together with natural language formed explanations of the causal questions. 

The following provides an instance from the e-CARE dataset:

|Premise:| Tom holds a copper block by hand and heats it on fire.|
|Ask-for:|Effect|
|Hypothesis 1:| His fingers feel burnt immediately. (√)|
|Hypothesis 2:| The copper block keeps the same. (×)|
|Explanation: Copper is a good thermal conductor.|
